# February 11, 1972 - Wilmington, Delaware - The Armoury

The mellotron s have to be tuned you see. - Boz

Quartet sound.

Rough board sound

Good dynamics in the opening part

Fripp running guitar line is sharp, crispy and energetic. Probably sounded great in the hall. Wallace drum work here is wonderful. Band sounds pretty jumping here.

Great Collins solo in the breakdown. Love Boz’s wide bass sound.

Fantastic opener.
 
Formentera transition with the flute is scene-setting after such a raucous opener. Lots of feedback. Unfortunate.

Can’t decide whether the music is trying to redeem the lyric or vice versa.

Great heartbeat bass drum overlaid with vocal improv, switch from flute to tenor sax, and we get a swinging jam going quickly. It gets the head nodding and quickly gets away from the continental lullaby of the track and into a kind of garage Motown. Almost feels like the band running away from the original piece. But I love it. The toes start tapping.

Love the transition into Sailor’s. Mel keeps phrasing as the tarantella cymbal work starts.

Robert’s transformation as a live player between 69 and this is remarkable. He and Mel really sound formidable. Robert’s solo over the dragging, snapping beat of the middle section is lovely as the mellotron builds.

Circus. I like what Boz is doing with the opening vocal lines. Hard to believe that this piece came across as anything other than plodding and uneven to a crowd that might have been there to hear 21stCSM and ITCOTCK. The mellotron sounds are so overdriven on this recording perhaps they had better play in the house sound. Here they’re a bit gritting. The modern version has a better sense of menace and inevitability to it than this one. I do like the sax solo over the electric piano sound

Ladies of the Road. Some blues grit from Fingers Fripp here. A fun piece to first showcase RF’s counterpoint to the vocal and then Mel’s gritty dungeon surf sax, but none of it can redeem the misogynistic lyric. May we forgive these young person’s their failures as we might forgive our own.

Groom - if I have to listen to 70 recordings of this band - then this is the piece I’ll look forward to every time. It immediately finds its way from the angular jazz opening theme to some kind of alternate funkiverse. My goodness Collins is extraordinary. Could be that the only Crimson drummer that can hold a candle to Wallace’s drum solo is Harrison. Giles never did this. Buford didn’t do this. I love it without the VCS3 synth that Sinfield liked to layer on. Absent here. Ohhh wait.... there it is! :) This actually sounds pretty good and mind bending. There has to be a hipster band that has brought this back into their live show somewhere today right?

Fripp’s ending to Groon coming out of the drum solo sounds almost Frippertronic-y

21csm. My goodness this must have been like seeing the picture of a monster come alive for folks who only knew this song from the studio album. Wonderful long gritty, grunge Fripp solo here. Bit of a sloppy re-entry to the syncopated solo ahead of the unison bit. Almost like the soloist and the band lost track of where they were. Clearly rapturous response to this. The crowd sounds insane!
