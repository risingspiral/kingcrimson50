## Context

We're doing it! We're breaking the rules.

One of the rules I had when starting this exercise is that as we move into dates that have multiple King Crimson events in different years that I would pick one and just cover that. But we've got two interesting recordings from this date and I think they both bear some mentioning.

We'll start backwards (or forwards?) with a continuation of sessions on February 1997 featuring Adrian, Robert, and Trey working through more ideas that would later go on to be a good part of Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part IV. 

Then we'll jump to 1972 and reflect on a rough (and I mean rough) sounding bootleg from the Florida stretch of the ongoing tour of 1972.

## Listening Notes 

### February 25, 1997 - Nashville, TN - SIR Studios

The unmistakable stomping chords of _Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part IV_ greet us immediately. Followed by the climbing scales of odd and terrifying origins. It's strange to hear this staple of 2000-2003 live performance stepping into the world with so much of the ideas fully formed. 

Not only do the ideas match the structure that eventually ends up on _The ConstruKction of Light_ album in 2000, but the players sound like they've got a good sense of it already. It's interesting to hear the players (particularly Ade and Trey) work on their parts during the circulation-ish multi-part section before the angelic chords come in around the 4 minute mark.

It's interesting to hear Robert's solo also sounding much as it would four years down the line from this session. 

"I can have fun with that." -- Robert

### February 25, 1972 - Miami Beach, FL - The Auditorium

**Pictures of a City**

Sourced from a rough audience bootleg this is a tough listen, but worth it for a few points I'd like to highlight.

First, it's fun to hear the audience as performer, band as background dynamic to this performance. You hear an "Oh my" early on in the performance of _Pictures of a City_ and you get a sense that a few of the folks attending are already getting their minds tickled.

During the fast running lines section of Pictures Robert really takes off. This feels faster than anything we've heard to date on this tour. He's running ahead and daring the band to catch up with him. It's breakneck stuff.

During Mel's solo in the jazz breakdown he pulls out these long, bleating horn notes that are eerie and beautiful.

The piece is met with rapturous applause

**Formentera Lady**

The conversation starts up around the audience mic as the opening part of Formentera plays out. Clearly folks are using this time to talk about what they heard and saw in Pictures rather than engaging with the ballad.

Ian's still doing some take on indian drum sounds to correspond with the lyric.

As the piece moves out of the structured part we get more falsetto scat from Boz than we've heard in a bit.
