**Pictures of a City**

Starts with an incomplete Pictures just near the end. Doesn’t sound particularly energetic but there’s an audible response from the crowd.
Followed by some energetic band banter while intro-ing Formentera.
Off the bat the recording sounds better and more balanced than the Wilmington show.
 
**Formentera Lady**

Love Fripp’s little harmonics ringing under Collins flute intro. Collins has this wonderful winding, dizzy flute accompaniment to the lyric about Spanish wheels leaning, drying in the sun. It’s wonderful to hear the little differences Fripp and Collins are exploring in the piece even at this stage in the band's tenure. Fripp in particular sounds like he’s feeling pretty free to roam here as Boz progresses through the vocal.

There’s a bit of calm, lovely wandering as the band slowly moves into the post-vocal jam. This is giving the piece a nice smooth building groove. Two recordings in and I’m really coming to love this jam. I like when Fripp steps back to just comp on chords and give Mel the stage. Ian really starts to play off of Mel a bit here as it moves towards frenzy but then Ian backs off and things calm and eddy out a bit.
 
Boz moves in here with a really high-falsetto scat. The jam then kind of falters out and we’re quickly into the Sailor’s Tale intro.

**Sailor’s Tale**

There’s some hard overbite blow from Mel here as the intro builds to the breakbeat and Fripp’s sustain solo over the mellotron. The mellotron comes in kind of sloppy and uneven, but goodness... Ian’s pocket and hi-hat work is such a lovely thing to get lost in here.

It’s interesting that they tighten this piece up and there’s no thrashing, slashing guitar solo.

Some fun little stage banter afterwards. Fripp was apparently reprimanded after the early show by the promoter to speak up when introducing the songs.

**Cirkus**
 
Again we’ve got that demonic plodding of these early versions of Cirkus that doesn’t really do it for me. Boz sounds a bit bored, but he does have a great moment where he screams off mic in a manic way after telling the crowd about how the ringleader invited him to join the parade.

After the mirror stops turning lyric the mood changes a bit with a lovely little melancholy tenor sax solo from Mel to Robert’s strings accompaniment. It might redeem this performance for me.

There’s an interesting accident (?) after the final verse where the mellotron drops in and out, but seems to do so in a way as to punctuate the main horn theme. I’m not sure if it’s a gaffe or Robert playing around.
