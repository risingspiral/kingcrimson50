## Context 

We finally jump out of the winter tour of 1972 and into Command Studios the following year where the line-up of Bruford, Cross, Fripp, Muir, and Wetton are working on the _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_ album. What a musical jump from the realm of jazz-driven Groon improvs to this! It feels like I've jumped sideways by a decade.

This was the album that "blew the top of my head off" when I first heard it in a dorm room in Kenosha, WI in the fall of 1995.

Here we have an isolation track of David, Robert, and John that DGM credits with being from the date of Feb. 21 working on _Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part II_. This is just a little more than a month from when the album would have been released.

## Listening Notes

It's unclear whether this is an isolation of the non-percussive tracks that make up the final cut on the last track of the album. If it's not it's awfully close. 

The track begins with a hi hat count-in and a false "start" from Fripp. I had the pleasure and privilege of attending an Introduction to the Guitar Circle course in Hope, New Jersey in the summer of 2015. 

Amongst the many lessons conveyed during that time was Robert's lecture on the distinction between a start and a beginning. With a start there is a lurching/stammering where 80% of the energy and opportunity of a thing is lost. 

With a beginning there is a potential that is carried through the action. As with so many lessons presented during the course this seemed like a pedantic distinction at first. But as I reflected on it in my practice on the guitar and in other aspects of my life I saw the wisdom in this distinction. 

The change in quality between when an action is started (full of error and risk) and begun (carrying a quality of intention which may give it resilience.) So... it's interesting to hear Robert "start". Not as a gotcha moment, but more as a recording of a minor event which would go on to form the wisdom that 40+ years on I would benefit from.

Back to the piece at hand.

In the ascending section the rich tone of the distorted guitar and violin is so.... comforting. It feels remarkably peaceful and contemplative here. It's very different from the rising power of the full performance.

The staccato accents from Cross in places are wonderful to hear. Delicacy and wood. That's what Cross brings to this album that gives it a balance of tone that is so essential.

In the final flourish there is this sustain line from Fripp which I don't think is in the final cut. If it's there I've never really noticed it until it surfaces in this mix. The ending bass sustain with Cross's bowing is wonderful and there's a reverse piano chord thrown in at the end a little reminiscent of _A Day in the Life_ which never made the cut to the final album.

This is a wonderful little treat for admirers of the _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_ album.
