#ProjeKct Three

## Context

With no recordings documenting performances on February 28-29, or March 1-2 we jump ahead to March 3.

We also start to make it into a period of Crimson history that saw more early year touring. So we're starting to venture out of the 1972 winter/spring tour. 

This is an infamous night in 2003 as the band was just beginning their tour following the release of _The Power to Believe_ album. On this night front-man and stunt-guitarist Adrian Belew fell ill. Too ill to play in fact. The rest of the band: Fripp, touch guitarist Trey Gunn, and percussionist Pat Mastelotto were faced with a choice: cancel the show or go ahead with a performance by the trio. 

The decision was made and ProjeKct Three leapt into action. In the late 90s Crimson dissolved into a series of sub-groups called ProjeKcts which worked out mostly improvised material in front of audiences. ProjeKct Three had last performed at SxSW in Austin in the spring of 1999. So here four years later with some Crimson material to base an hour or so performance around they were re-born.

## Listening Notes

**Introductory Soundscape**

Robert Fripp's practice of using digital looping technology to create sonic structures called Soundscapes dates back to the early 90s and his collaboration with ex-Japan frontman David Sylvian. Of course, Fripp's usage of looping as an approach to improvisational composition on the guitar dates back to his 1972 collaboration with Brian Eno on the album _No Pussyfooting_.

For my part there are several different eras of Fripp Soundscaping.

1992-1993 - Blue Period - encompasses Fripp's early use of the technology and is best exemplified on Sylvian|Fripp's _Damage_ and Fripp's _A Blessing of Tears_.
1994-1996 - Radio Period - Soundscape explorations largely in support of Crimson Double Trio touring. 
1997-2000 - Space Period - Solo 'scape structures of a wide variety that include the Evening of Space Music tour of early 97, the pop-up style ambient performances like in Green Park Station and the World Trade Center 
2003-2008 - Solar Period I - Support scaping for Crimson which evolved into performances that put traditional soloing over the top of themes such as _At the End of Time_ and covers the ProjeKct Six work
2004-2011 - Solar Period II - Parallels Solar Period I but this lineage starts with the tone arrived at during the _Equatorial Stars_ sessions with Brian Eno and carries up through his collaboration with Theo Travis and then Jakko Jakszyk.

This introductory soundscape here is a prime example of early Solar Period and I love it.

I could loop a surround sound album of this era of scapes for a long time without getting bored.

There's not much to write about soundscapes. It's like writing about the details of ocean waves. But here there's a lovely guitar solo near the end.
