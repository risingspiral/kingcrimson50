## Context 

The provenance of this gig is unknown. It’s from a date where the band may or may not have been in either Chicago or Detroit and we only have two tracks. Cirkus and Groon.

This is the first recording that we come across which originates from my birth region. I've seen King Crimson, a ProjeKct, a Crafty, or a Fripp performance in Chicago a total of 14 times which is nearly half of my live performance exposure to the world of Crim & Fripp. Listening to a recording from before I was born at a time of my parents early adulthood miles from where they were living is a trip for me.  

## Listening Notes

**Cirkus**

We start with some mellotron tuning and after having dealt with the poorly EQ’ed Detroit 18 show it sounds refreshingly clear. The low-end of Boz’s vocal is initially a bit boomy but this goes away and there’s a wonderful open-ness about this vocal.
 
The sonics here are good by comparison to most of what we’ve waded through from recordings on this tour. It’s a shame there isn’t a full show with this sound.
 
I’m not sure if it’s the improved acoustics or not, but Boz’s performance here feels more inspired than others. And this piece is approaching the majesty and menace that it strives for more than any performance I’ve heard from this early 1972 performance.

Fripp (I think it’s RF) even plays a bit with the mellotron phrasing between the second and third verses. Collins stretches some of this accompaniments further than usual.
 
More mellotron and electric piano theme-bending and it’s hard for me to believe that this is chronologically part of the same North American tour I’ve been listening to. Potentially later? Or maybe something mis-labeled from 1971? Nevertheless it might be my favorite performance from this stretch so far.

It’s greeted by what sounds like a half-empty room’s applause. Unfortunate.

**Groon**

Groon The fantastic! Groon The Never Boring! Again the sound here is great relative to other recordings from the tour. Mel adds some interesting squeaks during the head of the piece. As we move into the improv Robert presses down on the wah pedal and begin comping under Mel’s smooth solo. 

An interesting stereo pan happens in this recording as Mel shifts from the left to the right channel a bit and back again. Really funky.
